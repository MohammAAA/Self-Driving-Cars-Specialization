# Self-Driving-Cars-Specialization
This repo will contain my personal notes and summaries for the [Coursera's self driving cars specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/self-driving-cars). The specialization contains 4 courses:
1. Introduction to Self Driving Cars
2. State Estimation and Localization for Self-Driving Cars
3. Visual Perception for Self-Driving Cars
4. Motion Planning for Self-Driving Cars

These notes are being written in parallel to my progress in the specialization, so I'll most likely make some mistakes.
